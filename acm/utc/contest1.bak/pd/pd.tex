Little Petya really hates some number $z$. He defines the score of an integer as the number of time $z$ divides such integer.
More formally, the score of $x$ is the largest integer $y$ for which $z^y$ divides $x$.

Today little Petya is on the top-left cell (coordinates $(1,1)$) of a grid with $r$ rows and $c$ columns and a number is inside each cell.
He can only move either down and to the right without ever going outside the grid. He keeps moving until he reaches the bottom-right cell (coordinates $(r,c)$) of the grid.
When he finishes, he is given as number the product of every integer he has been on during his epic journey.
Help him find the minimum score possible of the number given to him.


\InputFile

On the first line, the 3 integers $r,c$ and $z$ has described in the statement.
Each of the next $r$ lines contains $c$ integers.
The $j-th$ integer $a_{ij}$ of the $i-th$ line corresponds to the cell $(i,j)$ of the grid.


The constraints are as follows:
$1\le r,c \le 2000$,\\ 
$1\le z \le 50000$,\\ 
$1\le a_{ij} \le 10^18$,\\ 

\OutputFile

Print a single integer, the minimum score achievable for little Petya.
If the answer is not defined (goes to infinity), print "-1".
