Oh, a very short problem statement for once.\\ 
Find the number of connected graph with $n$ vertices numbered from $1$ to $n$ and $m$ edges.\\
Since the answer can be pretty huge, output it modulo $10^9+7$.

\InputFile

The input consists of multiple test cases.
Each test case is described on one line by two integers, $n$ and $m$, the number of vertices and the number of edges of the graph.
The input end by a line with two zeros separated by a space.

The constraints are as follows:
$1\le n,m \le 100$,\\ 

\OutputFile

Output one line for each test case consisting of the answer to the problem asked.

\Example

\begin{examplewide}
\exmp{
0 1 12
}{
ans
}%
\end{examplewide}

\end{problem}
