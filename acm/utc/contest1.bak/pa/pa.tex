\begin{problem}{Timer}{stdin}{stdout}{2 seconds}



Recently during an expedition Indiana Bones discovered an old Mazteq ruins. 
Inside the temple he found a ingenious timer consisting of a single number $k$.
The instructions next to the timer state that each time it is day $y_1$ on the Maya calendar and day $y_2$ on the Azteq calendar the number on the timer decreases by 1 (it decreases at the very beginning of the day). Moreover it states that if the timer reaches $0$, the world ends, how original!.
You have been asked to find out how many days are left until the end of the world.
How fortunate that you took a minor in ancient civilizations not so long ago! You have no doubt that the following integers are going to help you find the answer: $T_1$, $T_2$, $x_1$ and $x_2$ which represent respectively the number of days in the Maya calendar, the number of days in the Azteq calendar, the current day in the Maya calendar and finally the current day in the Azteq calendar.

\InputFile

The input consists of the 7 integers described in the statement: $k$, $y_1$, $y_2$, $T_1$, $T_2$, $x_1$ and $x_2$.\\ 
The constraints are as follows:
$1\le k \le 10^9$,\\ 
$1\le x_1,y_1 \le T_1$,\\ 
$1\le x_2,y_2 \le T_1$,\\ 
$1\le T_1,T_2 \le 1000$,\\ 


\OutputFile

Output the answer on a single line.\\ 
Please use cout or \%Ld to print 64 integers in C/C++.
