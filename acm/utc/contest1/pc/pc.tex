\begin{problem}{How much is that?}{stdin}{stdout}{3 seconds}


How convenient, a very short problem statement for once :)\\ 
Find the number of connected graph with $n$ vertices numbered from $1$ to $n$ and $m$ edges.\\
Since the answer can be pretty huge, output it modulo $10^9+7$.

\InputFile

The input consists of multiple test cases.
Each test case is described on a single line by two integers $n$ and $m$, the number of vertices and the number of edges of the graph.\\
The input end by a line with two zeros separated by a space.\\ 

The constraints are as follows:\\ 
$1\le n \le 100$,\\ 
$0\le m \le 100$ 

\OutputFile

Output one line for each test case consisting of the answer.

\Example

\begin{examplewide}
\exmp{
3 2
2 1
0 0
}{
3
1
}%
\end{examplewide}

For the first instance, the three graphs are:
$\{(1,2),(2,3)\}, \{(1,2),(1,3)\}$ and $\{(2,3),(1,3)\}$

\end{problem}
