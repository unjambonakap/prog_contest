% Description: Робот перемещается по плоскости следуя некоторому наботу инструкций. Найти максимум |x|+|y| среди точек на его пути.

There is a robot who lives on a cartesian plane and likes to walk around it.
One day he planned a very interesting journey around the plane. To make that
journey he developed a program which he is going to follow. The program consists
of $n$ functions: $f_1$, $f_2$, $\ldots$, $f_n$. The $i$-th function $f_i$ is
a sequence of $c_i$ commands. Each command is of one of the following types:
\begin{shortitems}
\item
GO: Move forward one meter;
\item
LEFT: Turn 90 degrees to the left; 
\item
RIGHT: Turn 90 degrees to the right;
\item
F$k$: Follow the instructions of the function $f_k$, then continue following
the instructions of the current function.
\end{shortitems}

The robot starts the journey at his home located at the point with
coordinates $(0,0)$ following the instructions of the function $f_1$.

For example, consider the following set of functions:\\
\begin{tabular*}{\textwidth}{@{\extracolsep{\fill}} l l }
\begin{tabular}{ l l }
  $f_1$: & GO F2 GO F2 GO F2 \\
  $f_2$: & F3 F3 F3 F3 \\
  $f_3$: & GO LEFT \\
\end{tabular}
&

\end{tabular*}

The robot's journey for that case is shown on the picture.

In some cases the journey of the robot might never end. Consider for example
the set of instructions consisting of one function $f_1$ that has the following
commands: GO F1. In that case the robot keeps going forward and never stops.

The question that puzzles the robot now is how far from the home will he get
during his journey. That is, consider the set of all points which the
robot will visit. Find the maximum value of $|x| + |y|$ among all those points.
If there are points on the path of the robot with arbitrarily large values
of $|x| + |y|$, output ``\texttt{Infinity}''.

\InputFile

The first line of the input file consists of an integer number
$n$~$(1 \le n \le 100)$.
The following $n$ lines contain a description of the functions. The $i$-th line
describes function $f_i$. It consists of the number $c_i$~($1 \le c_i \le 100)$ --- the number
of commands for function $f_i$, followed by a description of each command.

\OutputFile

Output the maximum value of $|x| + |y|$ among all points visited during the journey
or ``\texttt{Infinity}''.
