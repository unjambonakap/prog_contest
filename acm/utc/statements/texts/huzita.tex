The first formal axiom list for origami was published by Humiaki Huzita and Benedetto Scimemi and has come 
to be known as the Huzita axioms. These axioms describe the ways in which a fold line can be generated 
by the alignment of points and lines. A version of the six axioms follows.

\begin{enumerate}
\item For points $p_1$ and $p_2$, there is a unique fold that passes through both of them.
\item For points $p_1$ and $p_2$, there is a unique fold that places $p_1$ onto $p_2$.
\item For lines $l_1$ and $l_2$, there is a fold that places $l_1$ onto $l_2$.
\item For a point $p_1$ and a line $l_1$, there is a unique fold perpendicular to $l_1$ that passes through point $p_1$.
\item For points $p_1$ and $p_2$ and a line $l_1$, there is a fold that places $p_1$ onto $l_1$ and passes through $p_2$.
\item For points $p_1$ and $p_2$ and lines $l_1$ and $l_2$, there is a fold that places $p_1$ onto $l_1$ and $p_2$ onto $l_2$.
\end{enumerate}

Roman is a good coder, but he is new to origami construction, so he decided to write a program to calculate the 
necessary folds for him. He already finished coding the cases for the first five axioms, 
but now he is stuck on the harder case, the axiom number 6. So he decided to hire a team of good 
coders --- your team --- to implement this case for his program.

\InputFile

The input consists of one or more test cases. The total number of test cases $t$ is specified in the first 
line of the input file. It does not exceed $20\,000$.

Each test case consists of exactly four lines, describing $l_1$, $p_1$, $l_2$ and $p_2$, in that order.
Each line is described by four integers --- the coordinates of two different points lying on it: 
$x_1$, $y_1$, $x_2$, $y_2$. Each point is described just by two integers --- its $x$ and $y$ coordinates. 
All coordinates do not exceed 10 by their absolute values. It is guaranteed that neither $p_1$ lies on 
$l_1$ nor $p_2$ lies on $l_2$. Lines $l_1$ and $l_2$ are different, but points $p_1$ and $p_2$ may be the same.

\OutputFile

For each test case write a separate line with the description of the straight line one should 
use for folding. Use the same format as in the input --- specify 
the coordinates of two points on it. Either $x$ or $y$ coordinates of those two points must differ 
by at least $10^{-4}$. Coordinates must not exceed $10^9$ by their absolute value.
The judging program will check that both the distance between $p_1$ after folding 
and $l_1$; and the distance between $p_2$ after folding and $l_2$ do not exceed $10^{-4}$. If there are
multiple solutions, any one will do. If there are no solutions, output the line of four zeros, separated by spaces.

\Example

The picture to the right illustrates the first sample. The fold line is dashed.
