\begin{problem}{Xtrapolation}{standard input}{standard output}{2 seconds}

This is an interactive problem. Your program will be run in parallel with 
jury program and must interact with it using standard input and standard
output. Jury program will wait for your program's responses, so you
must write a new line sequence and flush standard output after each line 
your program writes. Use the following code:

\begin{shortitems}
\item ``\verb|printf("\n"); fflush(stdout);|'' in C, 
\item ``\verb|cout << endl;|'' in C++, 
\item ``\verb|System.out.println();|'' in Java.
\end{shortitems}

You are given several positive integer numbers. After reading each integer number you must
print the sum of all integers received so far. The number $0$ indicates that the 
numbers are over, your program must exit after reading it.

\InputFile

Input contains several integer numbers, one on a line. The
next number will be given to you only after you print the sum of
integers you have received so far. After reading 0 your program must exit.

There are at most $1000$ non-zero numbers. All non-zero numbers are positive
and do not exceed $10^9$.

\OutputFile

After you read each number, print the sum of numbers received so far on a 
separate line and flush the standard output.
