% Description: Посчитать площадь многоугольника записанного в ASCII Art используя \ и /

Long time ago, most of PCs were equipped with video cards that worked only in 
text mode. If the programmer wanted to show a picture on a screen, he had to
use pseudographics or ASCII art like this:

\begin{center}
\includegraphics{pics/ascii-1.eps}
\end{center}

In this problem you are given a polygon, drawn using ASCII art. Your task
is to calculate its area.

The picture is formed using characters `\texttt{.}', `\texttt{\char`\\}',
and `\texttt{/}'. Each
character represents a unit square of the picture. Character `\texttt{.}'
represents an empty square, character `\texttt{/}' --- a square with a 
segment from the lower left corner to the upper right corner, and
character `\texttt{\char`\\}' --- a square with a segment from the upper left corner 
to the lower right corner.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics{pics/ascii-2.eps}
\end{center}

\InputFile

The first line of the input file contains integer numbers $h$ and $w$ 
($2\le h, w\le 100$) --- height and width of the picture.
Next $h$ lines contain $w$ characters each --- the picture drawn
using ASCII art.

It is guaranteed that the picture contains exactly one polygon 
without self-intersections and self-touches.

\OutputFile

Print to the output file one integer number --- the area of the polygon.

\Example

\exmp{
4 4
/\char`\\/\char`\\
\char`\\../
.\char`\\.\char`\\
..\char`\\/
