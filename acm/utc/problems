>>> stupid chinese remainder (done by simulation), have to know when the x-th ocurrence happens

>>> story: 1 player game, move on graph starting on a vertex. on one turn, cannot use the last edge used, can we play indefinitely?
Can add edge on graph 
# on line algo if there is cycle or not on dynamic graph (only add edge)


>>> grid, cells can have 3 (or 4, if there is in fact not a lot of solutions) values, no 2 adj cells have same value, find number of solutions (some cells can be already set)

>>> graph n nodes, have to pick k items in a fixed order. Items are available in some nodes, shortest path

>>> count number of graphs with n vertices and m edges

>>> 2 large strings, can change char, compare if 2 substr are =
