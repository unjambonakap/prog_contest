PROBLEM STATEMENT
You are given a vector <int> y of length N. 
The values in y describe N points in the plane: 
for each x = 0, 1, ..., N - 1 there is a point at coordinates (x, y[x]). 

Krolik is going to perform the following operation: 

	Choose two of the given points, say A and B, with different y-coordinates. 
	Consider the rectangle with sides parallel to coordinate axes and points A and B in two opposite corners. 
	Erase all points strictly inside the rectangle. 

Return the maximum possible number of points Krolik can erase by a single operation. 


DEFINITION
Class:PointErasingTwo
Method:getMaximum
Parameters:vector <int>
Returns:int
Method signature:int getMaximum(vector <int> y)


NOTES
-A point is strictly inside a rectangle if it is inside the rectangle and does not lie on the border of the rectangle. 


CONSTRAINTS
-y will contain between 2 and 50 elements, inclusive. 
-Each element of y will be between 0 and 50, inclusive. 
-y will contain at least 2 distinct elements. 


EXAMPLES

0)
{ 1, 2, 1, 1, 0, 4, 3 }

Returns: 2

If Krolik chooses A = (1, 2) and B = (4, 0), Krolik can erase two points: (2, 1) and (3, 1).




1)
{ 0, 1 }

Returns: 0

2)
{ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 }

Returns: 3

3)
{ 10, 19, 10, 19 }

Returns: 0



4)
{ 0, 23, 49, 50, 32, 0, 18, 50, 0, 28, 50, 27, 49, 0 }

Returns: 5
