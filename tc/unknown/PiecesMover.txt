PROBLEM STATEMENT
You are given a 5x5 board containing at most 5 pieces.  Your task is to move the pieces so that the cells occupied by them form a connected component.  A connected component is a set of cells where each pair of cells is connected by at least one path.  Consecutive cells in a path must all be adjacent.  Two cells are called adjacent if they share a common edge.
You are given a String[] board, where the j-th character of the i-th element is '*' if cell (i, j) is occupied by a piece and '.' otherwise.  Return the minimum number of moves required to achieve your goal.  Each move consists of moving one piece to an adjacent empty cell.
