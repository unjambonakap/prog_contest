PROBLEM STATEMENT
Krolik found a sheet of paper with an equation containing three positive integers: 
"a * b = c". 
This equation might be wrong, 
so Krolik is trying to make it correct by adjusting the numbers a, b, and c. 

You are given three ints a, b, and c. 
Return a int containing the minimum value of |A - a| + |B - b| + |C - c|, 
where A, B, and C are positive integers satisfying A * B = C. 


DEFINITION
Class:CorrectMultiplicationTwo
Method:getMinimum
Parameters:int, int, int
Returns:int
Method signature:int getMinimum(int a, int b, int c)


NOTES
-|x| is the absolute value of x (which is x for non-negative x and (-x) for negative x). 


CONSTRAINTS
-a, b, and c will each be between 1 and 1,000,000, inclusive. 


EXAMPLES

19
28
522

Returns: 2

By assigning A = 18, B = 29, and C = 522 the value of |A - a| + |B - b| + |C - c| is minimized.
