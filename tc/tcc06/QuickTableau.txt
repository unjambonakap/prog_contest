PROBLEM STATEMENT
A Young tableau is a two-dimensional array of integers such that each row and column is sorted in ascending order (rows left-to-right, columns top-to-bottom).  Given a vector <int> table with exactly 16 elements, all of which are distinct, you will return the fewest number of swaps required to turn table into a Young tableau.  table should be interpreted as a 4 x 4 array of integers.  More visually,
  table = { A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P }
    corresponds to the following 4 x 4 array

  A  B  C  D
  E  F  G  H
  I  J  K  L
  M  N  O  P ,

where A through P are integers.


DEFINITION

Method:numSwaps
Parameters:vector <int>
Returns:int

EXAMPLES

0)
{
 1,  2,  3,  4,
 5,  6,  7,  8,
 9, 10, 11, 12,
13, 14, 15, 16
}

Returns: 0

We already have a Young tableau.

1)
{
16, 15, 14, 13,
12, 11, 10,  9,
 8,  7,  6,  5,
 4,  3,  2,  1
}

Returns: 6



2)
{
 2,  1,  3,  4,
 5,  6,  7,  8,
 9, 10, 11, 12,
13, 14, 15, 16
}

Returns: 1

Here we only need to swap the first 2 values.

3)
{
 4,  3,  2,  1,
 5,  6,  7,  8,
 9, 10, 11, 12,
13, 14, 15, 16
}

Returns: 2
