PROBLEM STATEMENT
You are in a chat room that supports nickname tab-completion.  Suppose
the input buffer now contains the string s and you decide to use the
completion facility.  The first time you press tab you will be shown
the lexicographically first element of names that has s as a
prefix.  Pressing tab again will give the lexicographically second,
and so forth.  Once the possible options are exhausted the tab key
will do nothing.  Having found a completion that suits you, you may
either press enter to complete the word you are typing, or continue
typing characters into the input buffer.  If you decide to type
characters, they will be appended to the current completion.  Your goal
is to type the word w, followed by the enter key, using as few
keystrokes as possible.  Each character and each tab key count as single
keystrokes.  By interchanging character typing and tab completion
sequences as many times as you like, return the fewest number of
keystrokes required.


DEFINITION
Class:CheapestTabComplete
Method:getFewest
Parameters:vector <string>, string
Returns:int
Method signature:int getFewest(vector <string> names, string w)


NOTES
-If the buffer is empty, then every element of names is a possible completion for the buffer.
-The only allowed keystrokes are letters, tabs, and enter.


CONSTRAINTS
-names will contain between 0 and 50 elements, inclusive.
-Each element of names will contain between 1 and 50 lowercase letters ('a'-'z'), inclusive.
-w will contain between 1 and 50 lowercase letters ('a'-'z'), inclusive.


EXAMPLES

0)
{}
"myname"

Returns: 7

Since tab is useless, we type in the 6 letters of myname and then press enter.

1)
{"myn","myname"}
"myname"

Returns: 3

Here we press tab twice, and then enter.

2)
{"abc","ab","abcd","frankies","frank","a","a"}
"frankie"

Returns: 5

Here we type 'f', then tab, then 'i', 'e', and finally enter.

3)
{"a","a","f","f","fr","fr","fra","fra","fran","fran","frank","frank"}
"frankie"

Returns: 8

Due to the weird set of names, tab is of no use.

4)
{"a","a","bcde","bcde","bcde","bcdefghij"}
"bcdefghijk"

Returns: 6



5)
{"aaaa","aaaa","aaaa","aaaa","aaaa"}
