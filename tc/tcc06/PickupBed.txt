PROBLEM STATEMENT
We have a number of 4-foot long pipes that have regular octagonal cross-sections of
various sizes.
We want to place them in a pickup truck which is 4 feet wide, with the length of
each pipe extending across the width of the truck. Each pipe must  
rest with one of its 8 sides flat on the truck's bed. The front and
back sides of the
truck are higher than the pipes, so each pipe must fit entirely inside the truck.
How long will the truck have to be to hold them all?

        <--- length of truck --->              


Create a class PickupBed that contains a method length that is given a vector <int> ht
and returns the minimum length of truck that can hold all the pipes.
The i-th element of ht gives the height of a pipe when it is resting on one of
its sides. 



DEFINITION
Class:PickupBed
Method:length
Parameters:vector <int>
Returns:double
Method signature:double length(vector <int> ht)


NOTES
-A return value with either an absolute or relative error of less than 1.0E-9 is considered correct.


CONSTRAINTS
-ht contains between 1 and 8 elements, inclusive.
-Each element of ht is between 1 and 1000, inclusive.


EXAMPLES

0)
{5,5,5}

Returns: 15.0



   The pipes will lie with their perpendicular sides against each other. Each
   one will require the full 5 units of the truck's length.



1)
 {17}

Returns: 17.0



2)
{10,1,1}

Returns: 10.0



   We can put the big one between the 2 little ones. The little ones can fit entirely
   in the area under the slanted sides of the big one.


3)
{10,2,2}


Returns: 10.97056274847714
