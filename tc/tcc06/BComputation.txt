PROBLEM STATEMENT
You will be given B0, the first element of our sequence.  The following equation must hold for all n > 0: 
        0  =  B0 + n+1C1B1 + n+1C2B2 + ... + n+1CnBn 
Here aCb is the standard binomial coefficient (see the notes).  Return the value Bpos in the form "p/q" (quotes for clarity) where p and q are integers with no extra leading zeros and no common factors (other than 1).  The denominator q must always be positive. If the returned value is 0 then return "0/1".

DEFINITION
Class:BComputation
Method:getValue
Parameters:int, int
Returns:string
Method signature:string getValue(int B0, int pos)


NOTES
-aCb has value a!/(b!(a-b)!) where a! = a*(a-1)*...*2*1.


CONSTRAINTS
-B0 will be between -100 and 100, inclusive.
-pos will be between 0 and 15, inclusive.


EXAMPLES

0)
1
0

Returns: "1/1"

Here we simply return B0.


1)
1
1

Returns: "-1/2"

Using the given formula, we can compute 
B1 = -B0/2C1.

2)
100
11

Returns: "0/1"



3)
92
12

Returns: "-31786/1365"
