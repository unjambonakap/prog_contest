PROBLEM STATEMENT
We want to be able to express a fraction as a sum of two fractions that have small denominators.
Specifically, given a fraction a/b, we want to find fractions c/d and e/f such that
    a/b = c/d + e/f,  where d and f are positive    
    max(d,f) is as small as possible
    
Create a class FracSum that contains a method decompose that is given a and b and that returns
the smallest value for max(d,f).


DEFINITION
Class:FracSum
Method:decompose
Parameters:int, int
Returns:int
Method signature:int decompose(int a, int b)


CONSTRAINTS
-a and b will each be between 1 and 2,000,000,000, inclusive.


EXAMPLES

0)
14
10

Returns: 5



      14/10 = 0/1 + 7/5  is one way to keep the denominators less than or equal to 5.



1)
1
60

Returns: 12



       1/60 = -2/5 + 5/12 

2)
8
90

Returns: 9



      8/90 = -4/5 + 8/9
