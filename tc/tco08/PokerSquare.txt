PROBLEM STATEMENT
In the solitaire game Poker Square, you arrange cards into a 5x5 grid, and each column and row is treated as a poker hand, for a total of ten hands created.  You have partially filled the board, and have a few cards remaining.  The current layout of the board is given in the vector <string> board.  The cards remaining to be placed on the board are given in the vector <string> remaining.

Each hand is scored according to the following chart (the order of cards in a hand does not matter):

Royal Flush: (100 points) T, J, Q, K, A, all of the same suit (JS TS AS KS QS)
Straight Flush: (75 points) Five sequential card values, all of the same suit (7H 8H 9H TH JH)
Four of a Kind: (50 points) Four cards with the same value (2C 8S 8H 8C 8D)
Full House: (25 points) Three cards with the same value, and another two cards with a different value (8H 4C 8D 8C 4S)
Flush: (20 points) All cards the same suit (2C 5C 7C QC AC)
Straight: (15 points) Five cards with sequential values (8C 9S TC JH QD)
Three of a Kind: (10 points) Three cards with the same value (2C 4S 8H 8C 8D)
Two Pair: (5 points) Two cards with the same value, and another two cards with a different value (4H 4S 5H 8C 8D)
One Pair: (2 points) Two cards with the same value (2C 4S 8H 5C 8D)


The current board is given as five strings, each containing a space-separated list of five cards.  Each card is represented by two characters, the first character representing the value, and the second character the suit.  A card on the board denoted by two hyphens (--) represents a blank space that does not yet have a card placed.  Valid suits are 'S', 'H', 'D', or 'C'.  Card values, in increasing order, are '2'-'9', 'T', 'J', 'Q', 'K' or 'A'.

Return the maximum score you can achieve if you arrange the remaining cards optimally.


DEFINITION
Class:PokerSquare
Method:bestScore
Parameters:vector <string>, vector <string>
Returns:int
Method signature:int bestScore(vector <string> board, vector <string> remaining)


NOTES
-'A' (ace) is considered only as a high value, thus A, 2, 3, 4, 5 is NOT a valid straight.
-A hand will only score points for the highest matching point category.
-A hand that does not match any categories will score 0 points.


CONSTRAINTS
-board will contain exactly 5 elements.
-Each element of board will be in the format "C1 C2 C3 C4 C5", where each card is two characters, representing the value and suit of the card, or is "--" representing an empty space (quotes added for clarity).
-remaining will contain between 1 and 8 elements, inclusive.
-The number of elements in remaining will be equal to the number of empty spaces indicated in board.
-Each element of remaining will contain exactly two characters, representing the value and suit of the card.
-Each suit will be represented by 'S', 'H', 'D', or 'C'.
-Each value will be represented by '2'-'9', 'T', 'J', 'Q', 'K' or 'A'.
