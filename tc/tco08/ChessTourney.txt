PROBLEM STATEMENT

John is a chess player and is going to compete in the upcoming tournament. When a player loses a game, he immediately leaves the tournament.  Only the player who can win all his games will become the winner.


During the tournament John may win some prizes given in a vector <int> winnings. 
Element 0 of winnings represents the prize John gets for just entering the tournament, and element i of winnings (for i > 0) represents the amount John gets for winning his game in the i-th round. For example, if John wins the first two games and loses the third one, he'll get winnings[0] for entering the tournament, winnings[1] for winning his game in the first round (which grants him a spot in round 2) and winnings[2] for winning his second game and advancing to round 3. Losing in round 3 will give him nothing.


You've analyzed the play-off tree and now you know John's chances of advancing through each of the rounds, given in a vector <int> odds. Element i of odds represents the probability (as a percentage) that John will win his game in round (i + 1). Return John's expected winnings in the tournament.
