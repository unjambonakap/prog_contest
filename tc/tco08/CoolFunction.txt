PROBLEM STATEMENT
The function f: R -> R is called cool if there are integer numbers a0 <= a1 <= ... <= ak-1 (k >= 1) such that f(x) = |x - a0| + |x - a1| + ... + |x - ak-1| for every real value of x.

You will be given a vector <int> values, containing n elements. You should find a cool function f such that f(i) = values[i] for every i, where 0 <= i < n. Return a vector <int>, containing the values a0, a1, ..., ak-1 for this function. If there are many possible answers, choose the one with the smallest number of elements. If tie still exists, return the lexicographically smallest vector <int>. Constraints will guarantee that values corresponds to at least one cool function.

DEFINITION
Class:CoolFunction
Method:restore
Parameters:vector <int>
Returns:vector <int>
Method signature:vector <int> restore(vector <int> values)


CONSTRAINTS
-values will contain between 1 and 50 elements, inclusive.
-Each element of values will be between 0 and 50, inclusive.
-values will correspond to at least one cool function.


EXAMPLES

0)
{0}

Returns: {0 }

|x| is acceptable here.

1)
{50}

Returns: {-50 }

Here there are two variants with k=1: |x-50| and |x+50|. The second one is lexicographically smaller.

2)
{2, 4}

Returns: {-2, 0 }



3)
{3, 3}

Returns: {-2, 1 }



4)
{5, 1}

Returns: {1, 1, 1, 2 }

The return is not necessarily strictly increasing.

5)
{10, 4, 6}

Returns: {1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 4 }
