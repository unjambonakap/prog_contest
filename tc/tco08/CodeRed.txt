PROBLEM STATEMENT


We are looking for occurrences of the string "red" in a piece of text. For
example, in the text



    the detective questioned his credibility



we find "red" inside the word "credibility".



Capitalization doesn't matter, so in the text



    Server ERRED in Redirecting Spam



we find "red" at the end of "ERRED", as well as at the beginning of
"Redirecting".



Given a string, count the number of times "red" appears in
it with any capitalization.
