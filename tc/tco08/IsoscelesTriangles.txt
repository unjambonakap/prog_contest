PROBLEM STATEMENT
A triangle is called isosceles if it has two sides of equal length. Two triangles are considered to be different if they have different sets of vertices. You have a grid of N x M square cells.  Return the number of different isosceles triangles you can form using only the centers of grid cells as vertices.

DEFINITION
Class:IsoscelesTriangles
Method:count
Parameters:int, int
Returns:long long
Method signature:long long count(int N, int M)


CONSTRAINTS
-N will be between 1 and 200, inclusive.
-M will be between 1 and 200, inclusive.


EXAMPLES

0)
1
10

Returns: 0

Any three centers of grid cells will lie on the same straight line, so it's impossible to form a triangle at all.

1)
2
2

Returns: 4

We can select 4 triples of centers of grid cells, and all these triples will form isosceles triangles.

3

Returns: 10

All 10 isosceles triangles for a 2x3 grid are listed below ('X' stands for a triangle vertex):

XX.  XX.  .X.  X..  X.X
X..  .X.  XX.  XX.  .X.

.XX  .XX  ..X  .X.  .X. 
.X.  ..X  .XX  .XX  X.X
