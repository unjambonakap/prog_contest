PROBLEM STATEMENT

An integer x is called a proper divisor of an integer y if x is a divisor of y and 1 <= x < y.


Let us denote as s(a) the sum of all proper divisors of a.
An integer a is called almost perfect by k if |a-s(a)| <= k.


You are given ints left, right and k. Return the number of integers between left and right, inclusive, that are almost perfect by k.



DEFINITION
Class:AlmostPerfectNumber
Method:count
Parameters:int, int, int
Returns:int
Method signature:int count(int left, int right, int k)


CONSTRAINTS
-left will be between 2 and 1000, inclusive.
-right will be between left and 1000, inclusive.
-k will be between 0 and 1000, inclusive.


EXAMPLES

1

Returns: 4

The following numbers between 2 and 10 are almost perfect by 1: 2 (s(2) = 1), 4 (s(4) = 3),
6 (s(6) = 6) and 8 (s(8) = 7).
