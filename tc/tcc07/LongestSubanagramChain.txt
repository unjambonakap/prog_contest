PROBLEM STATEMENT

A word A is called an anagram of a word B if it is possible to change the order of letters in A to get the word B. For example, "coder" is an anagram of "decor".


A word A is called a subword of a word B if A can be obtained from B by removing some letters (possibly 0) from the beginning of B, and removing some letters (possibly 0) from the end of B.
For example, "coder" is a subword of "decoder".


A word A is called a subanagram of a word B if there is a word C such that C is an anagram of B and A is a subword of C. For example, "coder" is a subanagram of "record" because
the word "coderr" is an anagram of "record" and contains "coder" as a subword.


Let words A and B have the same number of characters. We say that word A dominates word B if for all i, the i-th letter of A is equal to the i-th letter of B or comes after it alphabetically. For example, the word "coder" dominates the word "amber", but doesn't dominate the word "after" (because the 3-rd letter of "coder" is "d" which comes alphabetically before "t" - the 3-rd letter of "after").


A sequence of words A0, A1, ..., An-1 of equal length is called a chain if, for all i from 1 to n-1, word Ai dominates word Ai-1.


You are given a vector <string> B. Return the maximal value of k where there exists a chain A0, A1, ..., An-1 such that all words in the chain have length k, and for all i, word Ai is a subanagram of word B[i].



DEFINITION
Class:LongestSubanagramChain
Method:getLength
Parameters:vector <string>
Returns:int
Method signature:int getLength(vector <string> B)


CONSTRAINTS
-B will contain between 1 and 50 elements, inclusive.
-Each element of B will contain between 1 and 50 characters, inclusive.
-Each element of B will contain only lowercase letters ('a'-'z').


EXAMPLES

0)
{"abaa", "abab", "aaba", "babb"}

Returns: 3

In this example the required chain is, for example, "aaa", "aba", "aba", "bbb".

1)
{"aa", "bbb", "ccc", "ddd", "eee"}

Returns: 2

Note that elements of B can have different length.

2)
{"coder", "coding", "topcoder", "program"}

Returns: 4



3)
{"b", "a"}

Returns: 0
