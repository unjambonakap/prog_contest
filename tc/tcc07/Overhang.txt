PROBLEM STATEMENT


We want to construct a stationary crane and place it on a flat roof.
We will make it by placing beams on top of each other and attaching a weightless
cable to the end of one of the beams. All the beams have the same
square cross-section but their lengths vary. Here is a picture
of a crane (with its load attached to the cable) that could be constructed using 3 beams.

======================        |
======================      LOAD
======================  
                      

We have already determined the order of the beams:
the first beam must
be placed on the roof, the second beam on top of it, etc. During
construction we can support the crane, but after construction is complete
and the load is attached to the cable the resulting crane must not fall apart.
Specifically, a topmost section of the crane will tip and fall if the horizontal position of
it center of gravity is to the left or right of the beam (the roof for the entire crane) on which it rests. 

We have chosen our units so that each beam's weight is the same as its
length. Given a vector <int> beam (the weights or lengths of each beam in order)
and LOAD, return the maximum overhang that we can achieve. 



DEFINITION
Class:Overhang
Method:hang
Parameters:vector <int>, int
Returns:double
Method signature:double hang(vector <int> beam, int LOAD)


NOTES
-The center of gravity of a mass is the average location of its weight. The center of gravity of a collection of masses can be computed as the weighted average of the centers of gravity of each mass.
-A return value with either an absolute or relative error of less than 1.0E-9 is considered correct.


CONSTRAINTS
-beam will contain between 1 and 50 elements, inclusive.
-Each element of beam will be between 1 and 20,000, inclusive.
-LOAD will be between 0 and 20,000, inclusive.


EXAMPLES

0)
{15}
0

Returns: 7.5



   This one-beam crane can't support anything, but at least it might
   provide some shade.



1)
{10}
40

Returns: 1.0



   Using a coordinate system in which the edge of the
   building is at x=0, the beam's center of gravity is at x=-4 
   and the load's center of gravity is at x=1 so their combined center of gravity is at 
   x = 10*(-4) + 40*(1) = 0.
   The crane is balanced at the edge of
   the building. 


2)
{10, 20, 10}
10

Returns: 11.0



   The best crane suspends the weight from the end of the middle beam
   in this case.


3)
{20,1,1,1,1,1}
5

Returns: 10.000000000000002

Here your can attach the load to the long beam that is resting directly on the roof, 
and then counterbalance the load by stacking the short beams as far to the left as
possible. 

4)
{1,1,1,1,1,20}
5

Returns: 8.089514476583442
