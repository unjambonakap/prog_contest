PROBLEM STATEMENT

You are given a polygon (possibly non-convex) with edges parallel to the coordinate axes.  The polygon is non-self-intersecting, meaning that no two of its edges share any common points, with the exception of vertices, each of which is shared between exactly two adjacent edges.


Consider all points with integer coordinates inside the polygon (including the points on its border). Sort all of them lexicographically (first, by x-coordinate, then by y-coordinate). You will be asked to return the coordinates of some points in this list.
 

You are given vector <int>s x and y, the i-th elements of which are the x and y coordinates, respectively, of the i-th vertex of the polygon in a counterclockwise traversal. You are also given a vector <string> k, each element of which is the index of a point in the sorted list.

Return a vector <string>, the i-th element of which is the k[i]-th point with integer coordinates inside the polygon (1-based).

Format each returned element as "x-coordinate y-coordinate" (quotes for clarity only, separate x and y coordinates with one space). 
For each i, if there are less than k[i] points, the corresponding element in the return value must be an empty string.



DEFINITION
Class:Polygon
Method:getKthPoint
Parameters:vector <int>, vector <int>, vector <string>
Returns:vector <string>
Method signature:vector <string> getKthPoint(vector <int> x, vector <int> y, vector <string> k)


CONSTRAINTS
-x will contain between 4 and 50 elements, inclusive.
-y will contain the same number of elements as x.
-Each element of x will be between 0 and 10^9, inclusive.
-Each element of y will be between 0 and 10^9, inclusive.
-x and y will describe a counterclockwise traversal of vertices in a polygon. 
-The polygon described by x and y will have edges parallel to coordinate axes.
-The polygon described by x and y will be non-self-intersecting.
-All vertices of the polygon will be distinct.
-k will contain between 1 and 50 elements, inclusive.
-Each element of k will be an integer between 1 and 10^18, inclusive, with no leading zeroes.


EXAMPLES

0)
{0, 2, 2, 0}
{0, 0, 2, 2}
{"1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9"}

Returns: {"0 0", "0 1", "0 2", "1 0", "1 1", "1 2", "2 0", "2 1", "2 2" }

These are all points that belong to a 2x2 square.

1)
{0,1,2,2,0}
{0,0,0,1,1}
{"1","6","2","3","5","4","7"}

Returns: {"0 0", "2 1", "0 1", "1 0", "2 0", "1 1", "" }

Note that there can be two consecutive parallel edges. Also note that k need not be sorted.

2)
{0, 5, 5, 3, 3, 4, 4, 3, 3, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0}
{0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 5, 5, 4, 4, 3, 3, 1, 1}
{"1","4","6","7","12","15","20","25","28","29"}

Returns: {"0 0", "0 4", "1 1", "1 2", "2 2", "3 0", "3 5", "4 4", "5 1", "" }



3)
{0,0,1,1}
{1,0,0,1}
{"1","2","3","4"}

Returns: {"0 0", "0 1", "1 0", "1 1" }

Note that the first edge can be vertical.
