PROBLEM STATEMENT

You are given a vector <string> text.  Concatenate all the elements to make one string.  A pair of non-empty two non-overlapping substrings of equal length (A, B) is called k-similar if there are no more than k positions where A and B have different characters. Return the number of distinct strings that belong to at least one such pair.
