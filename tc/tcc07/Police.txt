PROBLEM STATEMENT

There are n junctions in the city, some of them are connected by one-way roads. The mayor of the city would like to build police stations at some junctions to fight crime in the city.
Building a police station at junction i costs cost[i].


The police station at junction i is said to control junction j if it is possible for the police patrol to drive from junction i to junction j and back. Each junction must be controlled
by some police station.


You are given vector <int> cost and vector <string> roads. The j-th character of the i-th element of roads is 'Y' if there is a one-way road from junction i to junction j, or 'N' of there is none. Return the minimal total cost to build the police stations.


DEFINITION
Class:Police
Method:minimalCost
Parameters:vector <int>, vector <string>
Returns:int
Method signature:int minimalCost(vector <int> cost, vector <string> roads)


CONSTRAINTS
-cost will contain between 1 and 50 elements, inclusive.
-Each element of cost will be between 1 and 10^6, inclusive.
-roads will contain the same number of elements as cost.
-Each element of roads will contain n characters, where n is the number of elements of roads.
-Each element of roads will contain only characters 'Y' and 'N'.
-For all i the element i of roads[i] will be 'N'.


EXAMPLES

0)
{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
{"NNNYY", "YNNNN", "NNNYN", "NNYNN", "NYNNN"}

Returns: 4

You can build police stations in cities 1 and 3.

1)
{1000000,1000000}
{"NY", "YN"}

Returns: 1000000

It is enough to build one station.

2)
{5, 3, 10, 4}
{"NYNN", "NNYN", "NNNY", "YNNN"}

Returns: 3
