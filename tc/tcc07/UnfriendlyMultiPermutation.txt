PROBLEM STATEMENT
An array a[1], a[2], ... a[k*n]  is called a k-multipermutation if each number between 1 and n, inclusive, occurs exactly k times in it.
A k-multipermutation a is called unfriendly if no two adjacent elements in it are equal. For example, the 2-multipermutation (1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 3) is unfriendly,
but (1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 3) is not.
You are given ints n and k. Return the number of unfriendly k-multipermutations of size n. The answer can be quite large, so return it modulo 10^9+7.

DEFINITION
Class:UnfriendlyMultiPermutation
Method:count
Parameters:int, int
Returns:int
Method signature:int count(int n, int k)


CONSTRAINTS
-n will be between 1 and 20, inclusive.
-k will be between 1 and 5, inclusive.


EXAMPLES

0)
2
2

Returns: 2

There are two such multipermutations: (1, 2, 1, 2) and (2, 1, 2, 1).

1)
3
2

Returns: 30

2)
5
1

Returns: 120

All 1-multipermutations (or simply permutations) are unfriendly.

3)
2
4

Returns: 2
