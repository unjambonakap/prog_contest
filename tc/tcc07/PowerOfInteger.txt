PROBLEM STATEMENT

A number y is said to be the k-th power of a number x if y = x^k, i.e., y is the product of k copies of x.


You are given two strings left and right. Return the greatest k such that there is an integer y (left <= y <= right) such that y is the k-th power of some integer x.


DEFINITION
Class:PowerOfInteger
Method:greatestPower
Parameters:string, string
Returns:int
Method signature:int greatestPower(string left, string right)


CONSTRAINTS
-left will be an integer between 2 and 10^12, inclusive, without extra leading zeroes.
-right will be an integer between left and 10^12, inclusive, without extra leading zeroes.


EXAMPLES

0)
"5"
"20"

Returns: 4

The greatest power between 5 and 20 is 16=2^4.

1)
"10"
"12"

Returns: 1

No nontrivial power of integer between 10 and 12, so return 1.

2)
"2"
"100"

Returns: 6



3)
"1000000000000"
"1000000000000"

Returns: 12
