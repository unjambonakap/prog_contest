PROBLEM STATEMENT
I go on random bike rides. I go down my driveway, and then at each choice point I flip
a coin: Heads means to choose the leftmost road, Tails means to choose the rightmost. If there are 3 choices at
the intersection, I flip twice:  Heads Heads means to take the leftmost, Heads Tails means to choose
the middle road, Tails Heads means choose the rightmost, and Tails Tails is a "do-over" -- repeat the
whole process until a choice is made.

The ride continues until the random ride leads me back up my driveway to my house.
Here is a map of my neighborhood. All of the intersections where a choice can be
made are shown with a capital letter and my home is marked "Home".

Instead of actually flipping a coin while riding my bike, I record the results of
a sequence of flips to use during the ride. If during my ride I use them all then I start back at the
begining of the sequence. Given flips return the number of flips needed to get me
back home. If I never will get back home, return -1.


DEFINITION
Class:RandomRide
Method:flipCount
Parameters:string
Returns:int
Method signature:int flipCount(string flips)


CONSTRAINTS
-flips will contain between 1 and 50 characters, inclusive.
-Each character in flips will be 'H' or 'T'.


EXAMPLES

0)
"H"

Returns: 10



   Every choice will be left. My first flip is at A where my driveway hits the road. Then
   I go left around the curve and flip at B. My path continues going clockwise around
   the perimeter of my neighborhood, visiting intersections 
A, B, G, I, M, N, L, F, and A at which point my flip sends me home. 
   Only at intersection G is there a 3-way choice, thus requiring 2 flips. So I used H H HH H H 
   H H H H using a total of 10 flips at the 9 visited intersections. 



1)
"HHTTTTTHTHTHHHTT"

Returns: 11



   At A I turn left, go around the curve to B and go left there
   to G.  This is an intersection where there are 3 choices. I flip TT (do-over), 
   TT (another do-over), then TH so I turn right and go to C. At C the flip causes me to go right to B where I go "left" (it's really straight, but it is more to the left than the other choice) to A. Now I flip tails so I turn right and am home. The whole trip is A:H, B:H, G:TT TT TH, C:T, B:H, A:T for a total of 11 flips.

2)
"HTH"

Returns: 13



3)
"HHHTHHHHHHTTTHHHHHHHHHTTHHT"

Returns: 328
