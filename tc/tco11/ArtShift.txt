PROBLEM STATEMENT
Let S[0], S[1], ..., S[N-1] be a sequence of colors, each of which is either black or white. An art shift is a permutation (P[0], P[1], ..., P[N-1]) of integers between 0 and N-1, inclusive. It can be used to create a new sequence from the given one. For each i, the integer P[i] represents the position of the character of the previous sequence that will appear in the i-th position of the new sequence. In other words, if an art shift P is applied to a sequence S, the resulting sequence is (S[P[0]], S[P[1]], ..., S[P[N-1]]).

Given a sequence S and an art shift P, we can obtain new sequences, where each next sequence is obtained from the previous one by applying the art shift P. All these sequences are said to be reachable from S using P.

For simplicity, a sequence of N colors can be represented as a string containing N characters, where the i-th character is 'B' if the i-th color in the sequence is black and 'W' if the i-th color is white. Consider an example, where the initial sequence is "WBWWB" and the art shift P = {1,0,2,4,3}. Then after the first application of P we get "BWWBW", after the second application we get "WBWWB" and after the next applications we get "BWWBW", "WBWWB", "BWWBW" and so on. Overall in this case there are 2 different sequences reachable from the initial sequence using the given art shift.

Given an initial sequence, return the maximum number of different sequences that are reachable from it by using a single art shift.

DEFINITION
Class:ArtShift
Method:maxShifts
Parameters:string
Returns:int
Method signature:int maxShifts(string sequence)


CONSTRAINTS
-sequence will contain betweeen 1 and 30 characters, inclusive.
-Each character in sequence will be 'B' or 'W'.


EXAMPLES

0)
"BW"

Returns: 2

We can use an art shift of {1,0} to reach "WB" and then "BW" again for a total of two different reachable sequences.

1)
"BBBWBBB"

Returns: 7



2)
"BWBWB"

Returns: 6

A possible art shift that allows us to reach 6 different sequences is: {1,2,0,4,3}.

3)
"WWWWWWWWW"

Returns: 1

It does not matter what art shift we use; the sequence will always stay the same.

4)
"WWWWWWWWWBBWB"

Returns: 60
