PROBLEM STATEMENT
Warning: This problem statement contains superscripts and/or subscripts. It may not display properly outside of the applet.

In this problem we will consider binary polynomials. A binary polynomial P of degree n, where n is a nonnegative integer, is given by a sequence of coefficients: n+1 zeroes and ones a[0], a[1], ..., a[n], where a[n] = 1. They represent the following:

P(x) = a[0] * x0 + a[1] * x1 + ... + a[n] * xn

Binary polynomials can be evaluated in points 0, 1 and multiplied by each other just like ordinary polynomials, with one exception: all calculations take place modulo 2. For example, we assume that (x + x3) * (1 + x2) = x + 2 * x3 + x5 = x + x5. Since we can multiply binary polynomials, we can also raise them to positive integer powers; for example, if P = 1 * x0 + 0 * x1 + 1 * x2 and m = 3, then Pm = 1 * x0 + 0 * x1 + 1 * x2 + 0 * x3 + 1 * x4 + 0 * x5 + 1 * x6.


You are given integers m, k and a binary polynomial P as the array a of its coefficients. Return the coefficient that stands by xk in the binary polynomial Pm.

EXAMPLES

0)
{1, 0, 1}
3
4

Returns: 1

This corresponds to the example from the problem statement. Pm equals 1 + x2 + x4 + x6. The coefficient by x4 is hence 1.

1)
{1, 0, 1}
3
5

Returns: 0

This is the same polynomial as in the previous example.

2)
{0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1}
7
15

Returns: 1



3)
{1}
1
0

Returns: 1



4)
{1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0,
