PROBLEM STATEMENT

Consider the following function:
f(X) = Waai + X + Akari + X + Daisuki
Here, X is a string and + denotes string concatenation.
Waai, Akari and Daisuki are constant non-empty strings.



You are given 5 strings Waai, Akari, Daisuki, S and F, and a  int k. 
Compute how many times F occurs in f^k(S) as its substring. (The notation f^k(S) means that f is applied to S exactly k times in a row. See Notes for a formal definition.) Since the number can be quite large, compute the number modulo 1,000,000,007.


DEFINITION
Class:AkariDaisukiDiv1
Method:countF
Parameters:string, string, string, string, string, int
Returns:int
Method signature:int countF(string Waai, string Akari, string Daisuki, string S, string F, int k)


NOTES
-Formally, we have f^1(X)=f(X) and for k greater than one we have f^k(X)=f(f^(k-1)(X)).
-String A is substring of B if A can be obtained by erasing some (possibly zero) characters from the beginning of B and some (possibly zero) characters from the end of B.


CONSTRAINTS
-Waai, Akari, Daisuki, S, and F will contain between 1 and 50 characters, inclusive.
-Each character of Waai, Akari, Daisuki, S, and F will be a lowercase letter ('a'-'z').
-k will be between 1 and 10,000,000, inclusive.


EXAMPLES

0)
"a"
"b"
"c"
"x"
"axb"
2

Returns: 2

S = "x",
f(S) = "axbxc",
f^2(S) = f("axbxc") = "aaxbxcbaxbxcc".
This string contains the substring "axb" twice.

1)
"a"
"b"
"c"
"x"
"abcdefghij"
1

Returns: 0

The answer can be zero.

2)
"a"
"a"
"a"
"b"
"aba"
2

Returns: 4

S = "b",
f(S) = "ababa",
f^2(S) = f("ababa") = "aababaaababaa".
This string contains the substring "aba" four times. You must count overlapping substrings.

3)
"a"
"b"
"c"
"d"
"baadbdcbadbdccccbaaaadbdcbadbdccbaadbdcba"
58

Returns: 191690599



4)
"a"
"x"
"y"
"b"
"aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaab"
49

Returns: 1



5)
"waai"
"akari"
"daisuki"
"usushio"
"id"
