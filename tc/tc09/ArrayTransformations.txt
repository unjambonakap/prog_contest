PROBLEM STATEMENT

	You are given a vector <string> initialArray. Concatenate the elements of 
	initialArray to obtain a single space separated list of non-negative integers. Call this array A.



	You are allowed to perform operations of the following type on A. Choose two zero-based indices i and j 
	such that 0 <= i <= j < n, where n is the number of elements in A. For each k between i and j, 
	inclusive, if A[k] is greater than 0, decrease A[k] by 1.  The cost of such an operation is j - i + 1.


	You are allowed to perform at most K operations. The total cost of all these operations 
	must be less than or equal to M.  Your goal is to end up with an array where the largest 
	value is as small as possible.  Return the largest value in this final array.



DEFINITION
Class:ArrayTransformations
Method:minimalValue
Parameters:vector <string>, int, int
Returns:int
Method signature:int minimalValue(vector <string> initialArray, int K, int M)


CONSTRAINTS
-initialArray will contain between 1 and 50 elements, inclusive.
-Each element of initialArray will contain between 1 and 50 characters, inclusive.
-initialArray will contain only spaces and digits ('0'-'9').
-The elements of initialArray, when concatenated together, will contain a space-separated list of values. Let us call the concatenated string A.
-A will contain no leading, trailing, or consecutive spaces.
-A will contain between 1 and 250 values, inclusive.
-Each value in A will be an integer between 0 and 2,000,000, inclusive, with no extra leading zeroes.
-K will be between 1 and 500,000,000, inclusive.
-M will be between 1 and 500,000,000, inclusive.


EXAMPLES

0)
{"1 5 9", " 2 9 0 ", "1"}
10
5

Returns: 7

1)
{"1 5 9", " 2 9 0 ", "1"}
5
10

Returns: 6

One possible solution is to perform operations on the following indices

[1, 5] = (1, 4, 8, 1, 8, 0, 1)
[2, 2] = (1, 4, 7, 1, 8, 0, 1)
[2, 2] = (1, 4, 6, 1, 8, 0, 1)
[4, 4] = (1, 4, 6, 1, 7, 0, 1)
[4, 4] = (1, 4, 6, 1, 6, 0, 1)


The solution uses 5 operations with a total cost of 9.

2)
{"1 0 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0"}
3
7

Returns: 2

We can perform one operation on indices [2, 7] to get the array {1, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0}.

3)
{"765 358 938 10 ", "83", "9", " 172"}
100
200

Returns: 838

The original array is {765, 358, 938, 10, 839, 172}.
