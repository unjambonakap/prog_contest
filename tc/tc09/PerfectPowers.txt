PROBLEM STATEMENT
A number is called a perfect power if it can be written in the form m^k, where m and k are positive integers, and k > 1.
Given two positive integers A and B, find the two perfect powers between A and B, inclusive, that are closest to each other, and return the absolute difference between them. If less than two perfect powers exist in the interval, return -1 instead.

DEFINITION
Class:PerfectPowers
Method:nearestCouple
Parameters:long long, long long
Returns:long long
Method signature:long long nearestCouple(long long A, long long B)


NOTES
-1 is a perfect power.


CONSTRAINTS
-A will be between 1 and 10^18, inclusive.
-B will be between A+1 and 10^18, inclusive.


EXAMPLES

0)
1
4

Returns: 3

1 and 4 are the first pair of perfect powers.

1)
8
9

Returns: 1

8 and 9 are the closest pair of perfect powers.

2)
10
15

Returns: -1

No pair of perfect powers is present in the interval.

3)
1
1000000000000000000

Returns: 1

This is the largest possible range, and 8 and 9 are the closest pair of perfect powers.

4)
80000
90000

Returns: 80
