PROBLEM STATEMENT

There are two buildings opposite each other as in the figure below.
On the left building, there is a rectangular window, with the lower
and upper sides given by ylow and yhigh (the y-coordinate
as shown in the image: starting with 0.0 at the bottom and increasing
upwards). On the building on the opposite
side there is also a window, but it is not necessarily rectangular. Its shape
is a convex polygon, with the x- and y-coordinates (as
shown in the image: x-coordinate increasing to the back, y-coordinate starting
with 0.0 at the bottom and increasing upwards) of the corners given by the vector <int>s
xwindow and ywindow (the i-th corner is at the
x-coordinate xwindow[i] and at the y-coordinate
ywindow[i]). Between the two buildings there is an opaque wall of
height hwall, at a distance of dfrog from the left
building and dfly from the right building (assume that the wall
is infinitely thin).





A frog lies at some point on the window of the left building, and a
fly lies at some point on the window of the right building.
Assuming that the frog and fly are positioned randomly (uniformly) at
some point on the windows, what is the probability that the frog
can see the fly (i.e., the line of sight between them does not cross
the wall)?



DEFINITION

{5, 15, 15, 5}

Returns: 0.5

The windows on both sides are rectangular with the lower sides at height 5 and the upper sides at height 15. The wall is exactly in the middle between the buildings and has a height of 10. Due to the symmetric configuration, the probability of the fly being visible by the frog here is exactly 0.5 (50%).

{5, 5, 15, 15}
{5, 15, 15, 5}

Returns: 0.02

The same situation as above, just the wall has now a height of 14. If both the fly and the frog are above a height of 13, we have a symmetric configuration again with probability 0.5 of the fly being visible by the frog. If the frog or the fly (or both) is below a height of 13, the fly will not be visible by the frog. The probability of both being above a height of 13 is 0.2 * 0.2 = 0.04, so the total probability is 0.04 * 0.5 = 0.02.

{0, 10, 20, 30, 15}
{20, 10, 10, 20, 40}

Returns: 1.0

The wall has height 0, so even from the lowest point (ylow) the frog can always look at the fly.

{10, 20, 30, 20}
{20, 10, 20, 30}

Returns: 0.0

The wall is now too high and hides the whole opposite window, so the frog can never look directly at the fly.
