PROBLEM STATEMENT
On a horizontal line, there are two vertical pillars.
The distance between their bottoms is w.
The height of the first pillar is an integer, chosen uniformly at random in the range 1 through x, inclusive.
The height of the second pillar is an integer, chosen uniformly at random in the range 1 through y, inclusive.
The tops of both pillars will be connected by a straight piece of rope.

You are given the ints w, x, and y.
Compute and return the expected length of the rope.

DEFINITION
Class:Pillars
Method:getExpectedLength
Parameters:int, int, int
Returns:double
Method signature:double getExpectedLength(int w, int x, int y)


NOTES
-Your return value must have a relative or an absolute error of less than 1e-9.
-In this task, the expected rope length can be computed as the average rope length over all possible cases.


CONSTRAINTS
-w will be between 1 and 1000, inclusive.
-x will be between 1 and 100,000, inclusive.
-y will be between 1 and 100,000, inclusive.


EXAMPLES

Returns: 1.0

The rope always has a length of 1.

Returns: 2.387132965131785

There are 5 possible (equiprobable) cases in which the length of the rope is 1, sqrt(2), sqrt(5), sqrt(10) and sqrt(17). The correct answer is the arithmetic average of these 5 numbers.
