PROBLEM STATEMENT
Given a positive integer j greater than 1, the corresponding Collatz
sequence is produced by repeatedly applying f to j (and continues even after we reach 1).  The function f behaves as follows:

             { x/2    if x is even
   f(x)  =   {
             { 3x+1   if x is odd

Suppose someone began with the value y and has started (but not
necessarily finished) generating the Collatz sequence.  Each time they
apply f they write down 'E' or 'O' to denote whether the argument was even or odd,
respectively.  Given the string s they have written down,
you must return a String of the form (quotes for clarity) "ak+b".  Here a
and b are integers with no extra leading zeros.  The returned string
must make the following set the collection of all possible numbers
that could have begun the sequence:

	P = { ak + b | k >= 0 and ak + b > 1}

If there are multiple possible return values, choose the one with b minimal.

DEFINITION
Class:InverseCollatz
Method:getForm
Parameters:string
Returns:string
Method signature:string getForm(string s)


CONSTRAINTS
-s will contain between 1 and 50 characters, inclusive.
-Each character in s will be 'E' or 'O'.
-An 'O' will never be immediately followed by another 'O' in s.


EXAMPLES

0)
"EEE"

Returns: "8k+0"

The argument was even 3 times in a row, so the original value was a positive multiple of 8.

1)
"OE"

Returns: "2k+1"

The initial number had to be odd.  After multiplying by 3 and adding 1, the next value will definitely be even.

2)
"OEO"

Returns: "4k+3"

3)
"EEEEOEEEEOEEEEOEEEEOEEEEOEEEEOEEEEOEEEEOEEEEOEEEEO"

Returns: "2199023255552k+1014933810256"
