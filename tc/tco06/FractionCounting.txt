PROBLEM STATEMENT
Consider the following set (see notes for clarification):
  S = {  p/q  |   w <= p <= x,  y <= q <= z  }
  Given w, x, y, and z return the number of distinct elements in S.

DEFINITION
Class:FractionCounting
Method:howMany
Parameters:int, int, int, int
Returns:int
Method signature:int howMany(int w, int x, int y, int z)


NOTES
-S is the set of all rational numbers whose numerators are between w and x inclusive, and whose denominators are between y and z inclusive.


CONSTRAINTS
-x and z will be between 1 and 100, inclusive.
-w will be between 1 and x, inclusive.
-y will be between 1 and z, inclusive.


EXAMPLES

0)
1
1
1
1

Returns: 1

Only the value 1/1 is being considered.

1)
1
10
1
1

Returns: 10

Here S contains the values 1,...,10.

2)
1
2
1
2

Returns: 3

Here the values are 1/1, 1/2, 2/1, and 2/2.  Since 2/2 = 1/1 the answer is 3.

3)
2
4

4

Returns: 7

4)
