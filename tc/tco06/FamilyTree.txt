PROBLEM STATEMENT
We are keeping a family tree. We update the data by adding information as it 
becomes available. When information arrives that is not
consistent with the previous data, we need to recognize that fact immediately.
We will enforce only the most obvious rules:
    A person is either male or female.
    A child's parent cannot be the child itself or a descendant of the child 
    A child has two parents, one male and the other female.  

(A person is a descendant only of his parents, grandparents, greatgrandparents,
etc.)

Each piece of data gives either the names of a child and parent or the name of
a person and that person's gender. All occurrences of a name represent the same person. 
Create a class FamilyTree that contains a method firstBad that is given a
vector <string> data. The method returns the (0-based) index of the first element of data that is inconsistent
with the previous elements of data, or returns -1 if all the data is consistent.

Each element of data will be formatted in one of these two forms:
      "childname parentname"
      "name gender" 
where the two parts are separated by a single space character, each name is all
uppercase letters 'A'-'Z' and gender is a single lowercase letter, either 'm' or 'f'.


DEFINITION
Class:FamilyTree
Method:firstBad
Parameters:vector <string>
Returns:int
Method signature:int firstBad(vector <string> data)


CONSTRAINTS
-data will contain between 1 and 50 elements, inclusive.
-Each element of data will be formatted as above.
-Each element of data will contain between 3 and 50 characters, inclusive.


EXAMPLES

0)
{"BOB JOHN","BOB JOHN","BOB MARY","BOB m","AL f"}

Returns: -1



   Repeated data elements just give us more confidence. This data is all
   consistent. BOB's 2 parents are JOHN and MARY (it is not
   yet known which is the father and which is the mother), and BOB is male. We 
   also know that AL is female.



1)
{"BOB JOHN","BOB MARY","MARY JOHN","JOHN f","MARY f","AL f"}

Returns: 4


   The first 4 elements are considered consistent. They describe that BOB's 2
   parents are JOHN and MARY and that (unconventionally) MARY is JOHN's child.
   JOHN is female. But "MARY f" is inconsistent with this since that makes
   both of BOB's parents female.

2)
{"BOB JOHN", "CARLA BOB", "JOHN CARLA"}

Returns: 2


   After the first 2 elements we know that CARLA is a descendant of JOHN, so
   "JOHN CARLA" cannot be added.

3)
{"BOB RICK", "AL RICK", "AL PAULA", "PAULA LINUS", "LINUS BOB","BOB PAULA"}

Returns: 5


    The first 5 elements are consistent. BOB's descendant AL was a child of 
    RICK and PAULA, and RICK is BOB's parent. His other parent could not be 
    PAULA since PAULA is his descendant so the final element is the first one
    that is inconsistent.


4)
{"JOHN f", "JOHN m"}

Returns: 1
