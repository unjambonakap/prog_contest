PROBLEM STATEMENT
A bishop is a chess piece that can move any number of squares in any diagonal direction (see diagram below).

The chess board has dimensions xSize * ySize, where the top-left corner of the board has coordinates (0, 0), and the bottom-right corner has coordinates (xSize - 1, ySize -1).  The bishop is initially at coordinates (x, y). Find the total number of squares reachable by this bishop in k or less moves. Note, that initial square is always counted as reachable.
