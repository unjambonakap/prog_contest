PROBLEM STATEMENT
You are given two strings: A and B.  You would like to align these two strings by inserting '-' characters in them so that every character in A lines up with the same character in B or with a '-' in B, and vice versa.  Each maximal sequence of consecutive '-' characters costs x, plus an additional 1 per each '-' character.  For example, changing "ABC" to "A-B-C" costs x+1+x+1, while changing it to "A--BC" costs x+2.  Given, A, B, and x return the minimum cost to align the two strings.
