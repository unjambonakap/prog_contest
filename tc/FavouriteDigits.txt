PROBLEM STATEMENT

Tetka Rapotacka now plans to share this rumor with everyone, including Tetka Klepetacka.
Tetka Rapotacka has two favourite digits: digit1 and digit2.
She only likes numbers that contain at least count1 occurrences of digit1 and at least count2 occurrences of digit2.

You are given the long long N and the four ints digit1, count1, digit2, and count2.
Return the smallest integer that is greater than or equal to N, contains at least count1 occurrences of digit digit1, and at least count2 occurrences of digit digit2.
