PROBLEM STATEMENT
You have a collection of cards. Each card contains a single non-negative integer. The integers written on the cards are not necessarily distinct. You are given a vector<long long> number. Each element of number is a number written on one of the cards.

You may perform the following operation as many times as you want:

Choose two distinct cards. Let the numbers written on them be A and B, respectively.
Erase the number A and replace it with the number (A xor B). The number on the other card will remain unchanged (i.e., it will still be B).

Your goal is to maximize the sum of numbers written on your cards. Return the largest possible value of this sum.

DEFINITION
Class:XorAndSum
Method:maxSum
Parameters:vector<long long>
Returns:long long
Method signature:long long maxSum(vector<long long> number)


NOTES
-The operator "xor" in the problem statement is the bitwise xor operation. For example, we have 9 xor 3 = 10, because 9 in binary is 1001, 3 in binary is 0011, and their bitwise xor is 1010 in binary, which is 10 in decimal.


CONSTRAINTS
-number will contain between 1 and 50 elements, inclusive.
-Each element in number will be between 0 and 1,000,000,000,000,000 (10^15), inclusive.


EXAMPLES

0)
{1,0}

Returns: 2

One optimal solution is: change 0 into (1 xor 0) = 1. Then the sum will be 1+1 = 2.


1)
{1,2,3}

Returns: 8

One optimal solution is: change 1 to (2 xor 1) = 3. Then the sum will be 3 + 2 + 3 = 8.

2)
{0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0}

Returns: 0

We can't get any number other than 0.

3)
{2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19}

Returns: 233



4)
{123456789012345, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0}

Returns: 1234567890123450



5)
{627,674,281,272,289,877,62,122,603,189,615}

Returns: 10742



6)
{557}

Returns: 557
