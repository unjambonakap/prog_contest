PROBLEM STATEMENT
Warning: This problem statement contains superscripts and/or subscripts. It may not display properly outside of the applet.


Tomek and Wojtek are testing their new revolutionary BitX network transmission technology. It is based on a system of incredibly precise clocks. The transmission protocol uses a single cable and just two different voltages, called high and low. During the transmission of a sequence of bits the signal is high while '1' bits are being transmitted and low while '0' bits are being transmitted. Therefore, during the transmission of a sequence of bits b0, b1, ..., bm - 1 the number of signal changes is equal to the number of indices i between 0 and m - 2, inclusive, such that bi is different from bi + 1.


Tomek is going to transmit n elements of the arithmetic sequence a * x + b to Wojtek using BitX. He will transmit the binary representations of numbers a * 1 + b, a * 2 + b, ..., a * n + b sequentially, without any breaks or delimiters between consecutive numbers. For example, if a = 3, b = 5, n = 4, the sequence of bits he will transmit will be 10001011111010001. The number of signal changes will therefore be equal to 8.


You are given long longs a, b and n. Return the total number of signal changes during Tomek's transmission.
