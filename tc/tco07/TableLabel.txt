PROBLEM STATEMENT
A rectangular table of strings is formed by giving
each row and each column a label. Each label consists
of one or more uppercase letters. The
string in any row and column of the table is just 
the column label
appended to the row label. Here is an example with
2 rows and 3 columns

          X    XX   XXX

ABC     ABCX ABCXX ABCXXX
D       DX   DXX   DXXX


The problem is that we are given the table entries, but
don't know what the row and column labels are.
Given a vector <string> table, return a vector <string> containing
the column labels in left to right order, followed by the row labels in top to bottom order.
If there is no way to assign non-empty labels to the table, 
or if there are multiple ways to assign them, 
return a vector <string> with just one element, 
"none" or"multiple" (in lowercase, without the quotes).

The i-th element of table will give the i-th row of the table (i=0 is
the top row), with 
adjacent entries separated by one or more spaces. It may have leading
or trailing spaces.



DEFINITION
Class:TableLabel
Method:labels
Parameters:vector <string>
Returns:vector <string>
Method signature:vector <string> labels(vector <string> table)


CONSTRAINTS
-table will contain between 1 and 50 elements, inclusive.
-Each element of table will contain between 1 and 50 characters, inclusive.
-Each element of table will contain only spaces (' ') and uppercase letters ('A'-'Z').
-Each element of table will contain at least 1 entry.
-Each element of table will contain the same number of entries.


EXAMPLES

0)
{"  ABCX ABCXX   ABCXXX  ","DX DXX DXXX    "}

Returns: {"X", "XX", "XXX", "ABC", "D" }



    This is the example given above.




1)
{"AAA AAA"," AAA   AAA"}

Returns: {"multiple" }



    The row labels could both be "A" and the column labels both be "AA",
    or the row labels could both be "AA" and column labels "A".


2)
{"AB CD"}

Returns: {"none" }


  
    If the row label could be empty we could label this table by giving the
    columns the labels "AB" and "CD", but that is not allowed.
