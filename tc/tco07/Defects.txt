PROBLEM STATEMENT
A rectangular chip has some defects on its perimeter. We want to locate a
component on the perimeter of the chip as far as possible from the defects.
Specifically, we want to maximize the sum of the distances from the connector
to the defects, where the distance between the component and a defect is
the distance when travelling along the perimeter. (The distance is the shorter
of the counterclockwise or clockwise distances.)

The width of the chip is w and its height is h. Positions are given using a
coordinate system in which the corner opposite the corner (0,0) is (w,h).
Given w and h and double[]s defectw and defecth, return the maximal sum of 
distances to our component.


The i-th elements of defectw and defecth give the coordinates of the i-th 
defect.



DEFINITION
Class:Defects
Method:maxSum
Parameters:int, int, vector <double>, vector <double>
Returns:double
Method signature:double maxSum(int w, int h, vector <double> defectw, vector <double> defecth)


NOTES
-A return value with either an absolute or relative error of less than 1.0E-9 is considered correct.


CONSTRAINTS
-w and h will be between 1 and 100, inclusive.
-defectw will have between 1 and 30 elements, inclusive.
-defecth will have the same number of elements as defectw.
-Each coordinate pair in defectw and defecth will be on the chip perimeter.

    The chip has one defect, located in the corner. Locate the component on
  the opposite corner. Its distance along the perimeter to the defect is 2.

Returns: 6.0



    There are 3 defects located at (0,1), (0,1), and (2,0). We can place the component
    at (2,0), right on top of one of the defects. Then the sum of the distances 
    to the defects will be 3+3+0 = 6.
    If we placed the component elsewhere we could not get a sum of more than 6.
    For example, if we placed it at (2,1), its sum would be 2+2+1 < 6.
