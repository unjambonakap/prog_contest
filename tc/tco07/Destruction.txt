PROBLEM STATEMENT
We must determine whether or not a certain type of container can withstand a pressure
of 100.0, and if not determine as closely as possible the "critcal pressure", 
the greatest pressure that it can withstand. (We know that it can withstand a pressure
of 0.0.)

We can run multiple tests. Each test can test only a single pressure on
a single container, and the result of a test is either that the container survived
or was destroyed. If it survived it can be used in successive tests.

We must develop a testing protocol that uses no more than numTests 
tests and destroys no more than numDestroyed containers. The testing must
determine whether or not the container can withstand 100.0, and if it cannot it
must also estimate
the critical pressure as accurately as possible.
Given numTests and 
numDestroyed return the minimum absolute error we can guarantee in our estimate 
of critical pressure.



DEFINITION
Class:Destruction
Method:minError
Parameters:int, int
Returns:double
Method signature:double minError(int numTests, int numDestroyed)


NOTES
-A return value with either an absolute or relative error of less than 1.0E-9 is considered correct.


CONSTRAINTS
-numTests will be between 1 and 50, inclusive.
-numDestroyed will be between 1 and numTests, inclusive.

Returns: 50.0


    If the one test is at a pressure lower than 100.0 and the container survives, 
we won't know whether
or not the container can survive pressures greater than 100. So the one test
must be at a pressure of 100.0. If the container does not survive the test, then
we can estimate the critical pressure at 50.0, with a possible error of +- 50.0.

Returns: 16.666666666666664


First test pressure = 33.3333333. If the test container is destroyed, the estimate
is 16.66666667 with an error of +-16.6666667.
 
If the container survives the first test, we can run a second test  at 66.666667. 
If the container is destroyed, our estimate is 50.0. Otherwise we run our last test at
100.0 to determine whether to estimate 83.33333 or to report that these
containers can survive more than 100.0.
