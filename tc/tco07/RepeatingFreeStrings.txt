PROBLEM STATEMENT

A binary string s is called "repeating free" if no proper prefix equals a proper suffix of the same lengh. A substring is called "proper" if it differs from the whole string. For example, strings "0101011", "10", "10111100" are repeating free, but the string "01101011" is not. 


Return the k-th string among all repeating free strings with length n in lexicographical order (k is a 0-based index). Return an empty string if it doesn't exist.
