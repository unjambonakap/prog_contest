PROBLEM STATEMENT
The members of a committee vote 'Yes' or 'No' on various issues. However, some pairs of 
committee members have formed alliances, promising
never to cast opposite votes. No one is willing to vote contrary 
to her own opinion, so some of the members may need to
abstain from voting in order to avoid conflict between allies.

We have devised a method to determine who 
should abstain. Before each issue is voted on, we randomly assign each 
committee member an identifying number, 1, 2, ..., n. 
The member will then indicate her opinion on the issue. Then we will calculate
the smallest collection of abstentions that will avoid conflict.

The k-th element of the vector <string> voter contains the information about the 
k-th committee member -- the first element describes the member whose id is 1,
the second describes the member whose id is 2, etc. Each element contains its member's 
opinion, either 'Y' or 'N', followed by the identifying number of each higher-numbered member 
who has formed an alliance with its member.
 Return a vector <int> 
containing, in ascending order, the identifying numbers of the minimal collection
of members who must abstain from voting. If there is more than one minimal collection, 
return the one that is earliest lexicographically.


DEFINITION
Class:VotingBloc
Method:abstainers
Parameters:vector <string>
Returns:vector <int>
Method signature:vector <int> abstainers(vector <string> voter)


CONSTRAINTS
-voter will contain exactly n elements, where n is between 1 and 50, inclusive.
-Each element of voter will contain between 1 and 50 characters, inclusive.
-Each element of voter will be the character 'N' or 'Y' followed by a list of numbers.
-Each number on a list (which may be empty) will be preceded by one space (' ').
-The numbers on each list will be distinct, and will have no leading zeroes.
-Each number on each list will be less than or equal to n.
-Each number on the k-th list will be greater than the identifier of the k-th committee member. 


EXAMPLES

0)
{"Y 2","N"}

Returns: {1 }



   Here there are 2 members (1 and 2) and there is an alliance between them.
   Since they disagree on the issue, one of them must abstain. 
   We choose 1 since it is earlier lexicographically.



1)
{"N 2","N 3","Y"}

Returns: {2 }



   Member 2 has an alliance with both 1 and 3. If member 3 abstains there
   will be no conflict since all the remaining members vote N. If member 1 abstains
   a conflict will remain since 2 and 3 are allies who disagree. If member 2
   abstains, 1 and 3 are no longer in conflict. So there are two minimal sets
   of abstainers, and {2} is earlier lexicographically.
 

2)
{"N 2 3 4","N 3 4","Y 4","Y"}

Returns: {1, 2 }



   Each member is allied with all the other members. The only way to avoid conflict is
   for all those whose opinion is 'Y' to abstain, or for all those whose opinion
   is 'N' to abstain. Either way it will take 2 abstentions.


3)
{"N 2 3 4","N 3 4","Y 4","N"} 

Returns: {3 }



    This is the same as the preceding case except that now 3 of the members agree
    on 'N', so it takes only 1 abstention to avoid conflict.


4)
{"Y 2 3 4","Y 3 4","Y 4","Y"}

Returns: { }



    Everyone agrees, so no abstentions are needed.
