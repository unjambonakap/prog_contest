PROBLEM STATEMENT
Consider the following table:


The table has height rows and width columns.
Rows and columns are each numbered sequentially, starting from 0.
For each i, j: the cell in row i, column j contains the number (i*width+j).
For example, the table with height=2 and width=3 looks as follows:

0 1 2
3 4 5


A subtable of this table is any table that can be obtained from the original table by selecting a rectangle of cells and erasing everything outside the rectangle.

You are given the ints height and width, and a long long S.
If there is no subtable in which the elements sum to S, return -1.
Otherwise, return the smallest possible area of such a subtable.

DEFINITION
Class:RectangularSum
Method:minimalArea
Parameters:int, int, long long
