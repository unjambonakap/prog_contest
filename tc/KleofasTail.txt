PROBLEM STATEMENT

Let X be a nonnegative integer.
The Kleofas tail of X is an infinite sequence of nonnegative integers, defined as follows:


The first element is X.
After an even element Y, the next element of the sequence is Y/2.
After an odd element Z, the next element of the sequence is Z-1.


For example, the Kleofas tail of 60 starts as follows: 60, 30, 15, 14, 7, 6, ...


You are given long longs K, A, and B.
Return the number of integers X between A and B, inclusive, such that the Kleofas tail of X contains at least one occurrence of K.
