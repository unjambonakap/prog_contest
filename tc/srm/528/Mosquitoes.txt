PROBLEM STATEMENT
One day, Fox Ciel got surprised because there were many mosquitoes in her garden.
She decided to kill as many mosquitoes as possible by detonating a single bomb at a suitable place and time.



Ciel's garden can be seen as an infinitely long straight line. Mosquitoes are points, each moving with some constant velocity.
You are given vector <int>s xInit and v of equal length N. For each i between 0 and N-1, inclusive, there is a mosquito with current position xInit[i] and constant velocity v[i].



The current positions all correspond to a moment at time t=0. A mosquito that starts at the position X and has velocity V will be at the position X+Vt at time t. For example, a mosquito with velocity 0 stays at the same position forever, and two mosquitoes with velocities -1 and 1 are flying in opposite directions.



You are also given an int R: the radius of Ciel's bomb.
If a bomb is detonated at the position x at time t, it kills all mosquitoes that are at positions between x-R and x+R, inclusive, at that time.
The position of the bomb and the time of detonation do not have to be integers.
Ciel can detonate the bomb at any nonnegative time t (including t=0).
Your method must return the maximum number of mosquitoes she can kill by a single detonation.

DEFINITION
Class:Mosquitoes
Method:getMaximum
Parameters:vector <int>, vector <int>, int
Returns:int
Method signature:int getMaximum(vector <int> xInit, vector <int> v, int R)


CONSTRAINTS
-xInit will contain between 1 and 50 elements, inclusive.
-xInit and v will contain the same number of elements.
-Each element of xInit will be between -100 and 100, inclusive.
-Each element of v will be between -100 and 100, inclusive.
-All elements in v will be pairwise distinct.
-R will be between 1 and 100, inclusive.


EXAMPLES

0)
{1, -1}
{1, -1}
10

Returns: 2

There are many ways how to kill both mosquitoes. For example, she can detonate the bomb at time t=0 at position 0.

1)
{100, -100}
{1, -1}
10

Returns: 1

In this case, Ciel can only kill one mosquito.
Note that the two mosquitoes are flying away from each other.

2)
{0, -1, 10, -11, 99, -99}
{1, -1, -3, 3, 47, -47}
3

Returns: 4

In this case, an optimal solution is to detonate the bomb at position -0.5 at the time t=2.5.
Mosquitoes 0, 1, 2, and 3 will be killed by the bomb.

3)
{5}
{2}
8

Returns: 1



4)
{12,34,56,78,90}
{-1,2,-3,4,-5}
6

Returns: 3
