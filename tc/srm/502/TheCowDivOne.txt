PROBLEM STATEMENT
Farmer John had N cows numbered 0 to N-1. One day he saw K cows running away from his farm. Fox Brus computed the sum of the numbers of the escaped cows. She only told John that the sum was divisible by N.


Your task is to help John by counting the number of possible sets of escaped cows. This number may be very big, so return it modulo 1,000,000,007.
