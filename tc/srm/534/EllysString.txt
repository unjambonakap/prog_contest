PROBLEM STATEMENT
Elly has a string S. She wants to convert it to her favorite string T. You are given two String[]s s and t. Concatenate all elements of s to get the string S. Concatenate all elements of t to get the string T. S and T will contain the same number of characters.


Elly can perform two types of operations:

Choose a character and replace it with another character. For example, she can change "topcoder" to "topcodfr" by replacing character 6 (0-based index) with 'f'.
Choose two adjacent letters and swap them. For example, she can change "topcoder" to "tocpoder" by swapping characters 2 and 3 (0-based indices). She cannot change "topcoder" to "topdocer" because the characters being swapped must be adjacent.

Return the minimal number of operations required to convert S to T.


DEFINITION
Class:EllysString
Method:theMin
Parameters:String[], String[]
Returns:int
Method signature:int theMin(String[] s, String[] t)


CONSTRAINTS
-s and t will contain between 1 and 50 elements, inclusive.
-Each element of s and t will contain between 1 and 50 characters, inclusive.
-Each character in s and t will be a lowercase letter ('a'-'z').
-s and t will contain the same number of characters when concatenated.


EXAMPLES

0)
{"usagi"}
{"unagi"}

Returns: 1

Replace character 1 with 'n'.


1)
{"unagi"}
{"nugai"}

Returns: 2

In the first operation, swap characters 0 and 1 to get "nuagi". In the second operation, swap characters 2 and 3 to get "nugai".


2)
{"ellys", "string"}
{"e", "ll", "ysst", "ring"}

Returns: 0

Don't forget to concatenate strings. Both S and T are "ellysstring", so no operation is required.


3)
{"fox"}
{"xfo"}

Returns: 2

In the first operation, swap characters 1 and 2 to get "fxo". In the second operation, swap characters 0 and 1 to get "xfo".

4)
{"salmon"}
{"camlon"}

Returns: 2

In the first operation, replace character 0 with 'c' to get "calmon". In the second operation, swap characters 2 and 3 to get "camlon".

5)
{"boajxuidva"}
{"jcayduvida"}

Returns: 6

6)
{"vykdnujyezbcbmnatipqfuxqmgkvtn"}
{"qokbqyujeqcbwsinatupqfoegmvkdz"}
