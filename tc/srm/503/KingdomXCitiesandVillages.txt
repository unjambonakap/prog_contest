PROBLEM STATEMENT
The Grid Kingdom lies on a plane. There are N cities and M villages in the Grid Kingdom, each is a point on the plane. The i-th city is located at coordinates (cityX[i], cityY[i]) and the i-th village is located at coordinates (villageX[i], villageY[i]). Initially, there are no roads in the kingdom, so no village is initially connected to any city.  

To improve this, the king has ordered that each village shall be connected to a city by a system of roads. The scheme for building the roads is as follows: 

While there exists a village that is not connected to any city:

Pick one unconnected village (each has an equal probability of being chosen), call it V.
Select a point, X, which is nearest to V, in terms of Euclidean Distance, and is either a city or a village-that-is-already-connected-to-a-city. If multiple such points are equally near, pick any of the nearest points with equal probability.
Construct a road from V to X. The length of this road is equal to the Euclidean Distance between points V and X. V is now connected to a city.

Return the expected total length of all the roads that will be constructed after all villages are connected to a city.

DEFINITION
Class:KingdomXCitiesandVillages
Method:determineLength
Parameters:int[], int[], int[], int[]
Returns:double
Method signature:double determineLength(int[] cityX, int[] cityY, int[] villageX, int[] villageY)


NOTES
-The Euclidean distance between two points (X1, Y1) and (X2, Y2) is defined as the square root of ((X1-X2)^2 + (Y1-Y2)^2).
-The returned value must have an absolute or relative error less than 1e-9.


CONSTRAINTS
-cityX will contain between 1 and 50 elements, inclusive.
-cityY will contain the same number of elements as cityX.
-Each element in cityX and cityY will be between 0 and 1,000,000, inclusive.
-villageX will contain between 1 and 50 elements, inclusive.
-villageY will contain the same number of elements as villageX.
-Each element in villageX and villageY will be between 0 and 1,000,000, inclusive.
-The location of all cities will be distinct.
-The location of all villages will be distinct.
-There will be no pair of city and village that is located at the same location.


EXAMPLES

0)
{3}
{0}
{3,3}
{2,1}

Returns: 2.5

If village 0 is chosen first, the total length is 3. Otherwise it's 2. The expected length is their average.

1)
{1,4,7,10}
{5,5,5,5}
{1,4,7,10}
{4,4,4,4}

Returns: 4.0

This time the order doesn't matter, each village will be connected to the city closest to it.

2)
{1,2,3}
{4,4,4}
{4,5,6}
{4,4,4}

Returns: 4.166666666666667
