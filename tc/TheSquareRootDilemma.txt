PROBLEM STATEMENT
Consider the function SSR (Squared Sum of square Roots) defined on two positive integer parameters: SSR(A, B) = (sqrt(A)+sqrt(B))^2. We are interested in the cases when the value of the function is also an integer.

Given ints N and M, return the number of ordered pairs (A, B) such that 1 <= A <= N, 1 <= B <= M and SSR(A, B) is an integer.

DEFINITION
Class:TheSquareRootDilemma
Method:countPairs
Parameters:int, int
Returns:int
Method signature:int countPairs(int N, int M)


NOTES
-The answer to the problem is guaranteed to fit into signed 32-bit integer type under the given constraints.


CONSTRAINTS
-N will be between 1 and 77,777, inclusive.
-M will be between 1 and 77,777, inclusive.


EXAMPLES

0)
2
2

Returns: 2

Out of the four possible pairs (A, B), only two yield an integer result: SSR(1, 1) = 4 and SSR(2, 2) = 8.
On the other hand, SSR(1, 2) = SSR(2, 1) = 3+2*sqrt(2), which is not an integer.

1)
10
1

Returns: 3

SSR(1, 1), SSR(4, 1) and SSR(9, 1) are integers.

2)
3
8

Returns: 5

The valid pairs are (1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 8) and (3, 3).

3)
100
100

Returns: 310
