PROBLEM STATEMENT
Let's call a positive integer A totally odd if each digit in its decimal notation is odd, i.e., one of 1, 3, 5, 7, 9. For example, integers 9, 513, 77777 are totally odd and integers 2 and 99990 are not.

A positive integer N is called representable if it can be represented as N = A + B, where both A and B are totally odd numbers. For example, 2 = 1 + 1 and 4752 = 1377 + 3375 are representable, while 3 and 220 are not.

Given an int X, return the smallest representable number that is greater than or equal to X.

DEFINITION
Class:RepresentableNumbers
Method:getNext
Parameters:int
Returns:int
Method signature:int getNext(int X)


CONSTRAINTS
-X will be between 1 and 100,000,000, inclusive.


EXAMPLES

0)
1

Returns: 2

1 is not representable, and 2 = 1 + 1 is representable.

1)
999

Returns: 1000

999 is not representable, and 1000 = 999 + 1 is representable.

2)
2000

Returns: 2000

2000 = 1999 + 1 is representable.

3)
4201234

Returns: 4222222

All numbers between 4201234 and 4222221 are not representable, and 4222222 = 3111111 + 1111111 is representable.

4)
10101010

Returns: 10102222
