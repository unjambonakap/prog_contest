PROBLEM STATEMENT
NOTE: This problem statement contains superscripts that may not display properly if viewed outside of the applet.

You are a megadiamond hunter looking for diamonds in a peculiar mine.  The mine is a string containing only '<' and '>' characters.  Each megadiamond is a substring containing one or more consecutive '<' characters immediately followed by the same number of consecutive '>' characters.  For example, "<>", "<<>>" and "<<<<>>>>" are all megadiamonds.  Each time you find a megadiamond, you can remove it, and the corresponding characters are removed from the mine.

For example, if the mine looks like this:

><<><>>><

You can start by removing the first occurrence of "<>" to get:

><<>>><

You can then remove the megadiamond "<<>>" to get:

>><

There are no more megadiamonds, so your expedition is done.

The size of a megadiamond is the number of '<' characters it contains.  The value of a megadiamond of size n is n2.  The total income of your expedition is the sum of the values of the megadiamonds you removed from the mine.  Given a string mine, return the maximum possible income you can get from an expedition.
