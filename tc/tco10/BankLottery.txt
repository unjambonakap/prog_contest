PROBLEM STATEMENT
Most of the local Feudalian banks have started using a lottery system instead of paying interest in the traditional way.  It's a less expensive system for the banks, and most people don't seem to notice the difference.  One bank's current system works as follows.

After the end of each week, the bank holds a drawing.  Each bank account holder is given 1 ticket per dollar in his balance.  After all the tickets have been distributed, one ticket is chosen randomly.  Every ticket has an equal probability of being chosen.  The chosen ticket's owner wins weeklyJackpot dollars, which is immediately added to his balance.

You have just opened an account at the bank and would like to know your expected balance at some point in the future.  Somehow, you were able to access the current balances of all the account holders at the bank.  These balances are given in the vector <int> accountBalance.  Your initial balance is accountBalance[0], and each of the remaining elements of accountBalance is the balance of another person at the bank.  For the purposes of this problem, assume that no transactions other than those caused by the lottery system will occur, and assume that no accounts will be closed or created.  Return your expected balance after weekCount weeks.

DEFINITION
Class:BankLottery
Method:expectedAmount
Parameters:vector <int>, int, int
Returns:double
Method signature:double expectedAmount(vector <int> accountBalance, int weeklyJackpot, int weekCount)


NOTES
-The returned value must have an absolute or relative error less than 1e-9.


CONSTRAINTS
-accountBalance will contain between 1 and 50 elements, inclusive.
-Each element of accountBalance will be between 0 and 100000, inclusive.
-At least one element of accountBalance will be greater than 0.
-weeklyJackpot will be between 1 and 1000, inclusive.
-weekCount will be between 1 and 1000, inclusive.


EXAMPLES

0)
{100,100}
100
2

Returns: 200.0



1)
{2,2,2}
1
2

Returns: 2.6666666666666665

In the first week, there is a 1/3 probability that the balances will become {3,2,2}, a 1/3 probability that they will become {2,3,2} and a 1/3 probability that they will become {2,2,3}.

In week 2, {3,2,2} will have an expected value of around 3.4286 for account 0. {2,3,2} and {2,2,3} both yield an expected value of around 2.2857 for account 0. The total expected value is around 2.66667.

2)
{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}
100
20

Returns: 37.36363636363636



3)
{0,200,200,0,300,300,600}

776

Returns: 0.0

With no money in the account, the probability to win the lottery will always be 0.
