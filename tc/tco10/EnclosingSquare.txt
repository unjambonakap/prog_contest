PROBLEM STATEMENT
Find the area of the minimum square in the plane, 
such that its 4 vertices are distinct lattice points 
and there are exactly n lattice points strictly inside it. 
If there is no such square, return 0 instead. 


DEFINITION
Class:EnclosingSquare
Method:getMinimum
Parameters:long long
Returns:long long
Method signature:long long getMinimum(long long n)


NOTES
-A lattice point in the coordinate plane is a point whose x-coordinate and y-coordinate are both integers. 


CONSTRAINTS
-n will be between 0 and 1,000,000,000,000, inclusive. 


EXAMPLES

0)
4

Returns: 5

The square below contains exactly 4 lattice points strictly inside itself and has an area of 5. 



1)
3

Returns: 0

There is no such square. 


2)
1000000000000

Returns: 1000000000001



3)
101

Returns: 104



4)
85

Returns: 90
