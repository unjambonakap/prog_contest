PROBLEM STATEMENT
You are given a sequence 1, 2, .., N. M times, you pick two adjacently located numbers in the sequence and swap them. Return the number of different final sequences that can be obtained modulo 1,000,000,009.

DEFINITION
Class:SequencePermutation
Method:determineConfigurations
Parameters:int, int
Returns:int
Method signature:int determineConfigurations(int N, int M)


CONSTRAINTS
-N will be between 2 and 2000, inclusive.
-M will be between 0 and 2000, inclusive.


EXAMPLES

0)
3
1

Returns: 2

The possible resulting sequences are (1,3,2) and (2,1,3).

1)
3
0

Returns: 1

The only possible resulting sequence without swapping any of the elements is the original sequence, that is, (1,2,3).

2)
3
3

Returns: 3



3)
33
1803

Returns: 620284697

Watch out for integer overflow!
