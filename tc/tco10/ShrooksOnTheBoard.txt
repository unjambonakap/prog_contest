PROBLEM STATEMENT
A K-shrook is a fairy chess piece that can move horizontally in both directions for at most K squares. Here is an illustration of 2-shrook possible moves:



Two K-shrooks attack each other if one of them can reach the other shrook's square in one move. You are given a board with H rows and W columns. Find out the number of ways to place an arbitrary positive amount of K-shrooks on this board so that no two of them attack each other. Return this number modulo 100003.
