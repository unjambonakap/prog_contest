PROBLEM STATEMENT
Algrid2 is a program that uses a single grid with cells colored white or black as input and returns a new one as output. The grid has H rows and W columns. The topmost row is row 0, the bottommost row is row H-1, the leftmost column is column 0 and the rightmost column is column W-1. The cell at row i, column j can be denoted as (i,j). The program works by evaluating pairs of contiguous cells and making decisions depending on their contents. The following pseudo-code describes how the program works:


For i = 0 to H-2:
    For j = 0 to W-2:
        //Get the current colors of cells (i,j) and (i,j+1)
        A = Color(i,j) , B = Color(i,j+1)

        If (A,B) == (White, White) Then:
             Do nothing.
        EndIf
        If (A,B) == (Black, White) Then: 
             Repaint cells (i+1,j) and (i+1,j+1) Black.
        EndIf
        If (A,B) == (White, Black) Then:
             Repaint cells (i+1,j) and (i+1,j+1) White.
        EndIf
        if (A,B) == (Black, Black) Then:
             Swap the colors in cells (i+1,j) and (i+1,j+1).
        EndIf
    EndFor
EndFor


You will be given a possible output for the program as a vector <string> output. The j-th character in the i-th element of output represents the color of cell (i,j) where 'W' represents white and 'B' represents black. Count the total number of input grids that can generate this output. Two input grids are different if there is at least one cell in which the colors are different. Since the result may be very large, return it modulo 1000000007.

DEFINITION
