PROBLEM STATEMENT
There is a two-dimensional infinite plane. Toastman painted N of the grid points in the plane black. These grid points are numbered 0 through N-1. The coordinates of point i are (x[i],y[i]). They are chosen in such a way that no two points share the same x-coordinate and no two points share the same y-coordinate.


Toastwoman wants to color three of these N points: some point r will be red, some point g green, and some point b blue. She thinks a coloring is beautiful if x[r] < x[g] < x[b] and at the same time y[r] < y[b] < y[g]. (Note that the order of colors for the y-coordinate is not the same as the order for the x-coordinate.)


In order to have a large set of points, we will generate one using a pseudorandom generator. You will be given the int N specifying the number of points, and eight ints: xzero, xmul, xadd, xmod, yzero, ymul, yadd, and ymod. Generate the coordinates of the points in the following way:

x[0] = xzero
For each i between 1 and N-1, inclusive, x[i] = (x[i-1] * xmul + xadd) % xmod
y[0] = yzero
For each i between 1 and N-1, inclusive, y[i] = (y[i-1] * ymul + yadd) % ymod

Return the number of beautiful colorings for the set of points generated using the above procedure.

DEFINITION
Class:ThreePoints
Method:countColoring
Parameters:int, int, int, int, int, int, int, int, int
Returns:long long
Method signature:long long countColoring(int N, int xzero, int xmul, int xadd, int xmod, int yzero, int ymul, int yadd, int ymod)


NOTES
-There is a solution that does not use any properties of the pseudorandom generator. This solution would solve any set of N points within the time limit.


CONSTRAINTS
-N will be between 3 and 300,000, inclusive.
-xmod and ymod will be between N and 1,000,000,000, inclusive.
-xzero, xmul and xadd will be between 0 and xmod - 1, inclusive.
-yzero, ymul and yadd will be between 0 and ymod - 1, inclusive.
-No two points will have the same x-coordinate.
-No two points will have the same y-coordinate.
